                <h3>Optimal Loadouts for Counter-Terrorist Side in CS:GO:</h3>
                
                On the flip side, as Counter-Terrorists, a strategic and defensive approach demands a different set of arms. The M4A4 or M4A1-S are favored choices for their accuracy and controlled recoil, providing the necessary firepower for holding sites. The AWP, while slower than its counterpart, is a game-changer in the hands of a skilled sniper, denying terrorists entry from a distance. Counter-Terrorists should equip themselves with utility, including HE grenades, smoke grenades, and flashbangs. These tools are crucial for delaying enemy advances, controlling chokepoints, and maintaining a strong defensive posture. A well-balanced team that coordinates loadouts can effectively thwart terrorist offensives, securing victory for the Counter-Terrorist side in the ever-evolving rounds of CS:GO.
