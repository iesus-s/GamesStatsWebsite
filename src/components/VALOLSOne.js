                <h2>Optimal Loadouts for Attacking Side in Valorant:</h2>
                Navigating the tactical landscape of Valorant requires a carefully curated loadout on the attacking side. For those embracing the role of entry fragger, the Vandal or Phantom stands as the weapon of choice, offering rapid fire and versatility for close to mid-range engagements. Pairing it with a sidearm like the Ghost ensures adaptability in different scenarios. Sharpshooters seeking long-range dominance often lean towards the Operator, a powerful sniper rifle with the potential for one-shot kills. Coordinating agents may find utility in abilities like Phoenix's flashbangs or Breach's seismic disruption to break through enemy defenses. The attacking side thrives on swift execution, and these loadouts provide the firepower and tools necessary for successful assaults.
