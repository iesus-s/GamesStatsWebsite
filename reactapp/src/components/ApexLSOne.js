              <h2>Wraith</h2>
              <strong>Stay Mobile:</strong> Constantly move and reposition during engagements. Wraith's agility and small hitbox make her a challenging target.
              <br />
              <strong>Team Communication:</strong> Coordinate portal usage with your squad for strategic flanks or rapid escapes.

                  <strong>Use "Into the Void" Wisely:</strong> Master the timing of Wraith's tactical ability to dodge enemy fire or initiate surprise attacks.

                  <strong>Additional Wraith Tips:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Experiment with different portal placements to create unexpected flanking opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Communicate with your team about potential threats, and use "Into the Void" defensively to provide cover during critical moments.</li>
                    <li>Coordinate ultimates with your team for powerful combinations, such as using Wraith's portal alongside a Bangalore airstrike.</li>
                    <li>Wraith's passive ability, "Voices from the Void," warns you when danger approaches. Pay attention to these cues for better situational awareness.</li>
                    <li>Practice using the portal aggressively for rapid repositioning during fights, catching opponents off guard.</li>
                  </ul>
