            <h2>Optimal Loadouts for Defending Side in Valorant:</h2>
            <p>
              On the defending side, agents in Valorant prioritize loadouts tailored for strategic control and counter-play. The Guardian or Sheriff can be effective choices for defenders aiming to hold long angles with precise shots. The Bucky, a shotgun, becomes a potent weapon in close-quarters engagements, especially for agents like Sage or Cypher defending tight chokepoints. A well-coordinated defensive team may opt for the Operator to deny entry from a distance. Abilities play a crucial role in fortifying defensive positions, with agents like Killjoy deploying turrets and Cypher using surveillance tools to gain valuable intel. A strategic combination of weapons and abilities empowers the defending side to thwart enemy advances and secure victories in Valorant's intense tactical battles.
